        name: "Induction motor",
        description: "Nikola Tesla made his first induction motor in 1883 in Strasbourg, a year before his departure to America. It was a model of an induction motor with a rotating part in the shape of a disc. Today, induction motors are found in most devices that use electricity, such as mixers, washing machines, hair dryers, electric cars, and in factories.",
